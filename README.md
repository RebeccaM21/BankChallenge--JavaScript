# BANK CHALLENGE

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This challenge helps you practice your OO design skills.

You'll work alone, and you'll also review your own code so you can practice reflecting on and improving your own work.

### Requirements

* You should be able to interact with your code via the JavaScript console.  (You don't need to implement a command line interface that takes input from STDIN.)
* Deposits, withdrawal.
* Account statement (date, credit or debit amount, balance) printing.
* Data can be kept in memory (it doesn't need to be stored to a database or anything).

### Acceptance criteria

**Given** a client makes a deposit of 1000 on 10-01-2012  
**And** a deposit of 2000 on 13-01-2012  
**And** a withdrawal of 500 on 14-01-2012  
**When** she prints her bank statement  
**Then** she would see

```
date       || credit  || debit  || balance
14/01/2012 ||         || 500.00 || 2500.00
13/01/2012 || 2000.00 ||        || 3000.00
10/01/2012 || 1000.00 ||        || 1000.00
```


#### Standard
- [ ] Meets the spec
- [ ] Developed test-first
- [ ] Passes tests and code is linted
- [ ] Encapsulates adding and storing Transactions in a class
- [ ] Encapsulates Statement formatting in a class
- [ ] Encapsulates Transaction data in a class

#### Extended
- [ ] See a coach!

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

## Learning Objectives
- Build a simple program using functions, loops, and flow control
- Use `git` & GitHub to commit work and open a Pull Request

### Challenge Instructions

- Feel free to use google, your notes, books, etc. but work on your own.
- Keep it SIMPLE - it's not nearly as complicated as it first may look.
- You must [submit your challenge](https://airtable.com/shrUGm2T8TYCFAmjN) by the deadline, wherever you get to.
- Use your own test framework and evidence your test-driven development by committing on passing tests.
- Please write your own README detailing how to install your project, how to run the tests, how you approached the problem and provide screenshots of interacting with your program.
- If you refer to the solution of another coach or student, please put a link to that in your README.
- Please create separate files for every class, module, and spec.

## Steps

1. Fork this repo, and clone to your local machine
2. `npm install` to install project dependencies
3. Convert stories into a representative domain model and test-drive your work.
4. Run your tests using `npm test` or `node specRunner.js`
5. [Lint](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/getting-started) your source code using `npx eslint src` - Optional but recommended!

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your_username_/Project-Name.git
